<p>I'm Paloma Baca, a first-year at Carolina. In my free time I enjoy making friendship bracelets, editing video, and reading. I'm a Political Science and Environmental Science double major, with the hope of one day going into the lobbying sector.

<h2> Life and Education </h2>
<p1>I grew up just outside of Seattle, Washington, in a city called Bellevue. My education consisted of a dual language immersion program that taught my elementary education entirely in Spanish, a skill that I continue to use today. I moved to North Carolina in 2013, finishing up middle school and attending high school in Carrboro. The change between Seattle and Carrboro was staggering, mostly because of the weather (humidity kills!) but also because the cultures are staggeringly different. Overall though, my transition from one side of the country to another was sucessful, and I've made many lifelong friends while living here.
